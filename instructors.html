                    <p class="teach-text">Keith has practiced yoga for 20 years since sustaining a back injury from weight training. The concept of intertwining the breath and fluid movement drew him to the 
                        Ashtanga Vinyasa style of practice. In 2003, Keith decided to travel to Mysore in India, where he spent several months studying with BKS Iyengar. Following his return, 
                        he qualified as a 200-Hour teacher in 2006 with YogaTherapy Ireland. Since then Keith has completed the YogaAlliance.org 500hr Advanced Teacher training with 
                        The YogaRoom in 2013. Since then Keith has practiced and taught many styles of Yoga. His teaching style greatly values the importance of variety in sequences to 
                        explore asana in different ways, whilst always honouring the breath. Keith encourages each student to find their own level within a sequence and incorporate mindfulness 
                        n the practice. Keith continually seeks to improve and refine his teaching skills, regularly undertaking training courses with talented teachers. Most recently 
                        Keith has started learning from Rod Stryker of the Para Yoga lineage.</p>

                        meditation. Mari has studied Scaravelli yoga with Rosella Baronchini and completed an Anusara teacher training with Sianna Sherman, recently she has studied 
                        extensively in the Katonah yoga method. She began to meditate nine years ago during her teacher training, a practice that has taught her acceptance, humility and 
                        worthiness in equal measure. “That moment of Grace offered me a practice that transformed my life and taught me that our natural state is limitless freedom and 
                        overflowing wellbeing and that changes everything”. Mari’s teachings reveal how self inquiry and mindbody wisdom can help us navigate change and uncertainty and 
                        reclaiming the sacredness of life.</p>
