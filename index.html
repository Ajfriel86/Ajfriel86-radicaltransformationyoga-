                                 <hr>

                                    <p>Yoga's incorporation of meditation and breathing can help improve a person's mental well-being. <br />
                                        “Regular yoga practice creates mental clarity and calmness; increases body awareness; relieves chronic stress patterns; <br />
                                        relaxes the mind; centers attention; and sharpens concentration,” says Dr. Nevins.
                                    </p>
                                    <br />
                                    <p>
                                        If you’re a passionate yoga practitioner, you’ve probably noticed the benefits of yoga. Maybe you’re sleeping better or getting fewer colds or 
                                        just feeling more relaxed and at ease. But if you’ve ever tried telling a newbie about the benefits of yoga, you might find that explanations like 
                                        “It increases the flow of prana” or “It brings energy up your spine” fall on deaf or skeptical ears.

                                        As it happens, Western science is starting to provide some concrete clues as to how yoga works to improve health, heal aches and pains, and keep sickness at bay.
                                        Once you understand them, you’ll have even more motivation to step onto your mat, and you probably won’t feel so tongue-tied the next time someone wants Western proof.

                    <br />
                    <p>Yoga is an ancient form of exercise that focuses on strength, flexibility and breathing to boost physical and mental wellbeing. 
                        The main components of yoga are postures (a series of movements designed to increase strength and flexibility) and breathing.
                        The practice originated in India about 5,000 years ago and has been adapted in other countries in a variety of ways.
                         Yoga is now commonplace in leisure centres, health clubs, schools, hospitals and surgeries.

                    <p>
                        The origins of yoga are shrouded in the mists of time. The ancient wisdom known as "the supreme science of life" is believed to 
                        have been revealed to the great sages of India several thousand years ago.

                        Yoga is an ancient system of physical and mental practices that originated during the Indus Valley civilization in South Asia. 
                        The fundamental purpose of yoga is to foster harmony in the body, mind, and environment.
                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>      
                        Yoga professes a complete system of physical, mental, social, and spiritual development. For generations, this philosophy was passed 
                        on from the master teacher to the student. The first written records of the practice of yoga appeared around 200 BC in Yogasutra of Patanjali. The system consisted of the eightfold path or Asthangayoga.

                    <p>Keith has practiced yoga for 20 years since sustaining a back injury from weight training. The concept of intertwining the breath and fluid movement drew him to the 
                        Ashtanga Vinyasa style of practice. In 2003, Keith decided to travel to Mysore in India, where he spent several months studying with BKS Iyengar. Following his return, 
                        he qualified as a 200-Hour teacher in 2006 with YogaTherapy Ireland. Since then Keith has completed the YogaAlliance.org 500hr Advanced Teacher training with 
                        The YogaRoom in 2013. Since then Keith has practiced and taught many styles of Yoga. His teaching style greatly values the importance of variety in sequences to 
                        explore asana in different ways, whilst always honouring the breath. Keith encourages each student to find their own level within a sequence and incorporate mindfulness 
                        n the practice. Keith continually seeks to improve and refine his teaching skills, regularly undertaking training courses with talented teachers. Most recently 
                        Keith has started learning from Rod Stryker of the Para Yoga lineage.</p>

                        meditation. Mari has studied Scaravelli yoga with Rosella Baronchini and completed an Anusara teacher training with Sianna Sherman, recently she has studied 
                        extensively in the Katonah yoga method. She began to meditate nine years ago during her teacher training, a practice that has taught her acceptance, humility and 
                        worthiness in equal measure. “That moment of Grace offered me a practice that transformed my life and taught me that our natural state is limitless freedom and 
                        overflowing wellbeing and that changes everything”. Mari’s teachings reveal how self inquiry and mindbody wisdom can help us navigate change and uncertainty and
