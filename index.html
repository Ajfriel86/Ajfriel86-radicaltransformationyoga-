                                <p>Yoga is an ancient form of exercise that focuses on strength, flexibility and breathing to boost physical and mental wellbeing. 
                                    The main components of yoga are postures (a series of movements designed to increase strength and flexibility) and breathing.
                                    The practice originated in India about 5,000 years ago and has been adapted in other countries in a variety of ways.
                                    Yoga is now commonplace in leisure centres, health clubs, schools, hospitals and surgeries.

                                <p>
                                    The origins of yoga are shrouded in the mists of time. The ancient wisdom known as "the supreme science of life" is believed to 
                                    have been revealed to the great sages of India several thousand years ago.

                                    Yoga is an ancient system of physical and mental practices that originated during the Indus Valley civilization in South Asia. 
                                    The fundamental purpose of yoga is to foster harmony in the body, mind, and environment.

                                    Yoga professes a complete system of physical, mental, social, and spiritual development. For generations, this philosophy was passed 
                                    on from the master teacher to the student. The first written records of the practice of yoga appeared around 200 BC in Yogasutra of Patanjali. The system consisted of the eightfold path or Asthangayoga.

                                            “Regular yoga practice creates mental clarity and calmness; increases body awareness; relieves chronic stress patterns; <br />
                                            relaxes the mind; centers attention; and sharpens concentration,” says Dr. Nevins.

                                            If you’re a passionate yoga practitioner, you’ve probably noticed the benefits of yoga. Maybe you’re sleeping better or getting fewer colds or 
                                            just feeling more relaxed and at ease. But if you’ve ever tried telling a newbie about the benefits of yoga, you might find that explanations like 
                                            “It increases the flow of prana” or “It brings energy up your spine” fall on deaf or skeptical ears.

                                            As it happens, Western science is starting to provide some concrete clues as to how yoga works to improve health, heal aches and pains, and keep sickness at bay.
                                            Once you understand them, you’ll have even more motivation to step onto your mat, and you probably won’t feel so tongue-tied the next time someone wants Western proof.
