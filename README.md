<h1>Project-Name: Transformitive Yoga - Angus Friel</h1>
This is my first milestone projetc and I chose to take on this project by builing a website for a yoga studio that offers online and studio based yoga classes. I chose this topic as I have a friend that is a yoga instructor so obtain the content was very easy. I also used other sites and content ot help flesh it out.  



  
<h2>Features</h2>
<br />
This website will have information regarding yoga classes, both online and in studio. It is for anyone who wants to know more about yoga and this businessâ€™ yoga classes. 
<br />

<h3>Browser Icon</h3>
I replaced the oringal world icon with a "burn-alt" from fontawesome. This was done my using: https://gauger.io/fonticon/ to download the fontawesome icone and then embeded it into the header to create the burn icon on the browser tab.

<h3>Navigation Bar</h3>
The fully responsive navigation bar will have three pages, home(index.html), courses(courses.html) and sign up(singup.html). The nav bar will be across all three pages. 
This will allow the user to easily navigate across the website.

<br />
<h3>Instructors(instructors.html)</h3>
<br />
<li>I originally had this on the landing page and it just looked too clutered. After some consideration and playing around I realised the site's structure and asthetics would suite better if the instructors had their own page. It consists of three instructors with  their backgrounds in yoga as well the classes the teach and at what times. For the layout of this I had the instructors picture with their bio beside them and the class times underneath thier picture. </li>

<br />
<li>This page will consist of a form the user can fill in to take part in the classes or if they wish to just contact the studio if they have any quiries. It will have a drop down menu with different queries that the user can ask in relation to the topic they wish to discuss. also, next to this will be a google-map of where the studio is located so the user can find the studio easily.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Technologies used</h2>
<br /> 
This project consists of pure HTML5 and CSS.

<h2>Testing</h2>
<br />
<h2>Bugs!</h2>
<br />
Grid-box 
<br />
My grid box was non-responsive and all jumbled up on the screen. It took a while to figure it out but i realised i had multiple grids on the screen. Once I realised this and condensed the grids into one grid the issue was resolved. 
<br />
<h3>Overlapping DIVS:</h3>   
<br />
I had a problem with overlapping divs when the screen was reduced for mobile use. Thankfully I discovered unicorn revealer which helped me to identify the problem. It was the padding and the height. I removed the padding altogether and set the height to auto. This helped to resolve the issue. 
<br />
<h3>Social Icons on Footer:</h3>
<br />
For the life of me i could not firgure out why these icons would not algin in a row and not a coloumn. It turns out i was over complicating the issue. I added them to a list and tried to arrange that into Display, inline but nothing was work. After a quick gogle on my issue I then realised the i-tag is an inline tag anyway, like <iframe> so once i reverted them back without a list the problem was resolved. 
<br />
<h3>HTML</h3>
<br />
I had a few problems with random unclosed div's and other tags not being closed, as well as id's being used twice. All of this was found once I ran my code through W3 Validator and all errors were then corrected. 
<br />
<h3>CSS</h3>
<br />
I had one missing curly bracket from my CSS that was spotted once I ran it through the validator.
