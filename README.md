    Project-Name: Transformitive Yoga - Angus Friel
This is my first milestone projetc and I chose to take on this project by builing a website for a yoga studio that offers online and studio based yoga classes. I chose this topic as I have a friend that is a yoga instructor so obtain the content was very easy. I also used other sites and content ot help flesh it out.  

    UX

  
  Features
This website will have information regarding yoga classes, both online and in studio. It is for anyone who wants to know more about yoga and this businessâ€™ yoga classes. 

Existing Features

    Browser Icon
I replaced the oringal world icon with a "burn-alt" from fontawesome. This was done my using: https://gauger.io/fonticon/ to download the fontawesome icone and then embeded it into the header to create the burn icon on the browser tab. 

    Navigation Bar
The fully responsive navigation bar will have three pages, home(index.html), clases(classes.html) and sign up(singup.html). The nav bar will be across all three pages. 
This will allow the user to easily navigate across the website. 
    
    The Landing Page (index.html)
This is the focus of the page. It will have a hero image with some captions and below this will display the benefits of yoga and these benefits will be accompanied by various yoga icons and/or images. This is to inspire the user about the benefits they will recieve if they were to particpate in a yoga class or classes. 
Below this section, there will be some videos of classes taking place with instructors and some pictures to help show the user what they will be in for if they were to participate in a class.
The footer will have links to facebook, instagram, and youtube, as well an email link to directly contact the studio. 

    Classes(classes.html)
This page will have the various classes a user can take part in. From introduction classes to yoga training classes. These clases will have accompying pctures and videos. Each class displayed will have a sign-up button that wil take them to the sign-up page.

    Instructors(instructors.html)
I originally had this on the landing page and it just looked too clutered. After some consideration and playing around I realised the site's structure and asthetics would suite better if the instructors had their own page. It consists of three instructors with  their backgrounds in yoga as well the classes the teach and at what times. There is also two videos at the bottom of the page to help introduce new comers to yoga. 

    Sign Up(signup.html)
This page will consist of a form the user can fill in to take part in the classes or if they wish to just contact the studio if they have any quiries.

    Technologies used: 
This project consists of pure HTML5 and CSS.

    Testing

    Bugs!
Grid-box: 

My grid box was non-responsive and all jumbled up on the screen. It took a while to figure it out but i realised i had multiple grids on the screen. Once I realised this and condensed the grids into one grid the issue was resolved. 

Overlapping DIVS:    

I had a problem with overlapping divs when the screen was reduced for mobile use. Thankfully I discovered unicorn revealer which helped me to identify the problem. It was the padding and the height. I removed the padding altogether and set the height to auto. This helped to resolve the issue. 

Social Icons on Footer:

For the life of me i could not firgure out why these icons would not algin in a row and not a coloumn. It turns out i was over complicating the issue. I added them to a list "<ul>," and tried to arrange that into "Display: inline" but nothing work. After a quick gogle on my issue I then realised the "<i>" is an inline tag anyway, like "<iframe>" so once i reverted them back without a list the problem was resolved.
